### Prior Probability
This is a probability we assign *prior* to making any observations. So, for example:

> The probability that a bird can fly is 0.99, though if it is wounded it is 0.4.

$P(\text{fly}) = 0.99$ is our prior probability.

### Posterior Probability
We assign a posterior probability after we've made observations of the environment. So, leading with the previous example:

> The probability that a bird can fly is 0.99, though if it is wounded it is 0.4.

$P(\text{fly} | \text{wounded}) = 0.4$ is our posterior probability, as we've made the observation that the bird is wounded.
