We make strong assumptions and do not have the ability to assert and retract them.

> Deductive logic is monotonic

If $\Delta$ logically implies $\alpha$, then $\Delta$ and $\Gamma$ will also logically imply $\alpha$.
	This is because our belief system makes a strong assumption on $\Delta$, so whenever it is true, we believe it implies $\alpha$ regardless of any other knowledge.

For a non-monotonic ssystem,we need a *Degree of Belief* to quantify our assumptions, and we look to [[Probabilistic Reasoning]].
